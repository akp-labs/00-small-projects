# 00-small-projects

 A collection of small coding projects and experiments in HTML, JS, and Python. Mini projects, games, and tools for practice and learning.
 These mini projects, games, and utilities are designed for **learning, practice, experimentation, and fun**.


## Overview

 There a many small projects that may not need a complete repo and that is why they have been kept inside this single repo.
 There are directories for each category of projects(based on their language...).
 
 **Also serving the purpose of a Bridge repo: small projects from home to school lab.**
## Repository Structure

- **`c-cpp-csharp-projects/`**  
  Contains subfolders for **C**, **C++**, and **C#** projects.  
  These include small console applications, algorithms, and learning exercises.  

- **`html-js-css-projects/`**  
  Web-based mini projects like **calculators, interactive games, prank pages, and word counters**.  
  Fully client-side and playable in any modern browser.  

- **`java-projects/`**  
  Small Java experiments for practice and learning. Focused on console applications and basic OOP exercises.  

- **`python-projects/`**  
  Python scripts, utilities, and mini games. Projects range from **pattern printers** to **fun prank scripts** and console tools.  

Each folder contains its own `README.md`.
